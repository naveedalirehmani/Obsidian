Hereâ€™s a structured unit test report for the Solidity smart contract `Election`. Each test case is written based on the functional requirements. The tests will be for core functionalities, ensuring correctness and robustness.


### Functional Test Report for Election DApp (Frontend + Smart Contract)

| **Action**                                                   | **Expected Result**                                       |

| **Display Total Number of Votes Cast**                       | Total votes display correctly on the election results page. |

This report outlines the key actions that should be tested to ensure the frontend communicates correctly with the smart contract and handles user interactions as expected.
