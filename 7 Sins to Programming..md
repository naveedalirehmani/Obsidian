### 1. **Not using programming standards.**

1. **Code formatting.**
    - Ensure consistent code formatting for readability.
2. **Mostly decided by the team.**
    - Teams usually agree on a standard format.

### 2. **Design Principles.**

1. **Follow SOLID.**
    - **Single Responsibility:** Each class should have one responsibility.
    - **Open/Closed:** Classes should be open for extension but closed for modification.
    - **Liskov Substitution:** Subtypes should be substitutable for their base types.
    - **Interface Segregation:** Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use.
    - **Dependency Inversion:** Depend on abstractions, not on concrete implementations.

### 3. **Design Patterns.**

1. **Creational Patterns.**
    - Methods for creating objects.
2. **Structural Patterns.**
    - Ways to assemble objects and classes into larger structures.
3. **Behavioral Patterns.**
    - Methods for objects to interact.

### 5. **Naming Adequate.**

1. **Avoid encodings.**
    - Do not use complex encodings in names.
2. **Expand abbreviations.**
    - Use full words instead of abbreviations.
3. **Use clear distinctions.**
    - Names should clearly distinguish their purpose.
4. **No Magic values, (use named constants).**
    - Avoid hard-coded values; use named constants instead.
5. **Be descriptive with your names.**
    - Choose names that describe their function and purpose.

### 6. **Writing Tests.**

1. **This can be very difficult when working with poorly architected code.**
    - Testing is harder if the code is not well-structured.
2. **Unit | Integration | End to End**
    - Write tests at various levels: unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests.

### 7. **Double the time initial time estimate.**

1. **Creation goes hand & hand with problems.**
    - Building something new often involves unforeseen issues.
2. **Try not to rush.**
    - Take your time to avoid mistakes and ensure quality.
