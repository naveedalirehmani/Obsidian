Software Engineering Ethics means following rules that ensure good and fair behavior. such as Privacy, Honest, Accountability & Compliance.
Privacy is about keeping user data safe and secret. Honesty is being clear about what the software can and can't do, and how it's progressing. Accountability is taking responsibility for your work and fixing any problems that arise & Compliance is following all laws and regulations. 
These principles help create trustworthy and reliable software.


Stay flexible and open to new ideas, technologies, and methods. Look for creative solutions to problems and suggest improvements. By embracing change you can help ensure the project's success.


Choose real-world problems to solve and create systems from scratch. This hands-on approach helps you understand the challenges and requirements of system architecture. Experiment with different design patterns, and learn from your mistakes. Building your own projects is a great way to develop your skills and gain valuable experience.
maybe if you are a web developer you can start by hosting you very own full stack app & then progress to much complex architectural patterns such as microservices.


Microservices offer many benefits, such as the ability to scale parts of the system independently, use different technologies for different services, and improve system reliability since one service failure wonâ€™t crash the whole system. They also enable faster development and deployment, easier maintenance. works best with agile!
