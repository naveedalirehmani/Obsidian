**Hashing.**
Hashing is a fundamental concept in computer science and cryptography. It refers to the process of taking an input (or data) of any size and applying a specific mathematical algorithm to generate a fixed-size output, which is usually a sequence of characters or numbers. This fixed-size output is known as the hash value, hash code, or simply the hash.

The primary purpose of hashing is to create a digital fingerprint or unique identifier for the input data.
