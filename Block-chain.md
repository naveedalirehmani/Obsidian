**Hashing.**
Hashing is a fundamental concept in computer science and cryptography. It refers to the process of taking an input (or data) of any size and applying a specific mathematical algorithm to generate a fixed-size output, which is usually a sequence of characters or numbers. This fixed-size output is known as the hash value, hash code, or simply the hash.

The primary purpose of hashing is to create a digital fingerprint or unique identifier for the input data.

**Characteristics.** 

- **Deterministic:** For the same input, the hash function will always produce the same hash value.
- **Quick Computation:** The hash function should be fast and efficient, allowing for rapid generation of hash values.
- **Preimage Resistance:** Given the hash value, it should be computationally infeasible to determine the original input data.
- Small Changes in Input Produce Significant Changes in Hash: Even a minor modification in the input data should result in a completely different hash value.
- **Collision Resistance:** It should be highly improbable for two different inputs to produce the same hash value.

**Some of the hash functions and their characteristics are.** 

- **MD5 (Message Digest Algorithm 5)**: 128-bit hash value. However, MD5 is now considered to be weak for cryptographic purposes due to vulnerabilities and collision attacks discovered over the years.
- **SHA-1 (Secure Hash Algorithm 1)**: 160-bit hash value. Similar to MD5, SHA-1 is considered weak for security applications due to vulnerabilities. It is no longer recommended for cryptographic purposes.
- **SHA-2 (Secure Hash Algorithm 2)**: SHA-2 is a family of cryptographic hash functions that includes SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-384, and SHA-512. These functions produce hash values of different lengths: 224, 256, 384, and 512 bits, respectively. SHA-2 is widely used and considered secure for various cryptographic applications.
- **SHA-3 (Secure Hash Algorithm 3)**: SHA-3 is a family of cryptographic hash functions standardized by NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology). It offers improved security and resistance against certain types of attacks compared to SHA-2. The SHA-3 family includes hash functions such as SHA3-224, SHA3-256, SHA3-384, and SHA3-512, providing hash values of different lengths.
- **RIPEMD-160 (RACE Integrity Primitives Evaluation Message Digest 160)**: RIPEMD-160 is a cryptographic hash function that produces a fixed-size, 160-bit hash value. It is commonly used in various applications such as digital signatures and certificate authorities.
- **bcrypt**: bcrypt is a password hashing function commonly used for securely storing passwords. Unlike regular hash functions, bcrypt is intentionally slow, which makes it more resistant to brute-force attacks.
- **BLAKE2**: BLAKE2 is a cryptographic hash function that offers high performance and security. It is an improved version of the earlier BLAKE hash function and provides hash values of different lengths. BLAKE2 is designed to be fast and secure, suitable for various cryptographic applications such as message authentication, digital signatures, and key derivation.
