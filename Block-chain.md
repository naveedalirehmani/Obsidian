**Hashing.**
Hashing is a fundamental concept in computer science and cryptography. It refers to the process of taking an input (or data) of any size and applying a specific mathematical algorithm to generate a fixed-size output, which is usually a sequence of characters or numbers. This fixed-size output is known as the hash value, hash code, or simply the hash.

The primary purpose of hashing is to create a digital fingerprint or unique identifier for the input data.

**Characteristics.**Â 

- **Deterministic:** For the same input, the hash function will always produce the same hash value.
- **Quick Computation:** The hash function should be fast and efficient, allowing for rapid generation of hash values.
- **Preimage Resistance:** Given the hash value, it should be computationally infeasible to determine the original input data.
- Small Changes in Input Produce Significant Changes in Hash: Even a minor modification in the input data should result in a completely different hash value.
- **Collision Resistance:** It should be highly improbable for two different inputs to produce the same hash value.
