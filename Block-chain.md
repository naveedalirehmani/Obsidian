**Hashing.**
Hashing is a fundamental concept in computer science and cryptography. It refers to the process of taking an input (or data) of any size and applying a specific mathematical algorithm to generate a fixed-size output, which is usually a sequence of characters or numbers. This fixed-size output is known as the hash value, hash code, or simply the hash.

The primary purpose of hashing is to create a digital fingerprint or unique identifier for the input data.

**Characteristics.** 

- **Deterministic:** For the same input, the hash function will always produce the same hash value.
- **Quick Computation:** The hash function should be fast and efficient, allowing for rapid generation of hash values.
- **Preimage Resistance:** Given the hash value, it should be computationally infeasible to determine the original input data.
- Small Changes in Input Produce Significant Changes in Hash: Even a minor modification in the input data should result in a completely different hash value.
- **Collision Resistance:** It should be highly improbable for two different inputs to produce the same hash value.

**Some of the hash functions and their characteristics are.** 

- **MD5 (Message Digest Algorithm 5)**: 128-bit hash value. However, MD5 is now considered to be weak for cryptographic purposes due to vulnerabilities and collision attacks discovered over the years.
- **SHA-1 (Secure Hash Algorithm 1)**: 160-bit hash value. Similar to MD5, SHA-1 is considered weak for security applications due to vulnerabilities. It is no longer recommended for cryptographic purposes.
- **SHA-2 (Secure Hash Algorithm 2)**: SHA-2 is a family of cryptographic hash functions that includes SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-384, and SHA-512. These functions produce hash values of different lengths: 224, 256, 384, and 512 bits, respectively. SHA-2 is widely used and considered secure for various cryptographic applications.
- **SHA-3 (Secure Hash Algorithm 3)**: SHA-3 is a family of cryptographic hash functions standardized by NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology). It offers improved security and resistance against certain types of attacks compared to SHA-2. The SHA-3 family includes hash functions such as SHA3-224, SHA3-256, SHA3-384, and SHA3-512, providing hash values of different lengths.
