I've built web and mobile applications serving thousands, if not millions of users in real-time. As the only developer on the job, I can handle everything, capable of taking your project from frontend to backend, all the way to managing cloud engineering & DevOps.

Below are a few links for websites I have built:

1 : https://gilgit.app/

2 : https://cannect.ca/

3 : https://www.flower.box/

  
I also have a Bachelors in Software Engineering & diploma from an Ivy League ( Harvard University ). With proven experience in the field, I am confident that if selected, I can bring my skills to the new position and contribute significantly to the success of the project.
