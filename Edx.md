**Tell us about your current financial situation. Why do you need assistance?**

I live in the remote northern area of Pakistan called Hunza. This is where I've grown up and spent most of my life. My days have been centered around working on my parents' farm, which is how my family makes money. We're in the middle class and we always had financial troubles. My parents have had to sacrifices alot to put food on the table and for basic things in life. In my family, there's me, my older sister, and my younger brother.

Right now, I'm a student studying software engineering. It's been a struggle financially to pay for my college fees. I've tried to get jobs before, but it's been really hard to find anything steady. Here in Gilgit Baltistan, where I live, there aren't many chances to work in computer science. The computer industry is pretty new here. On top of that, we have problems with electricity, and the internet doesn't reach everywhere. Because of this, there's a big gap for anything related to computers.

Getting through each day and making sure I can afford my education has been tough. My family's income from the farm can only stretch so far. I've been determined to learn about software engineering, even though it's not easy to find opportunities in my area. I've applied for jobs in the past, hoping to earn some money for college, but none of them turned into a stable job as I have not much on my resume and getting this certificate would help a lot.

Our location makes things like electricity and internet a real challenge. The computer science field is still growing here, and that means there aren't many chances for someone like me who's studying software engineering.

I'm asking for assistance because I really need it. It's about being able to keep studying and working toward my goals. Financial help would mean the world to me. As a student, it's difficult to hunt for a job when my resume is empty. Getting this certificate will help a lot, and I believe it will make me stand out in the job market.

I believe that with some support, I can keep pushing forward. With an education in software engineering, I could bring positive changes not just for myself, but for my whole community.

and lastly, I want to mention that. I'm grateful for the course offered by edX and I am really thank full for the opportunity.

**Tell us about your learning or professional goals. How will a Verified Certificate in this course help you achieve these goals?**

My goals are centered on learning software engineering and getting a job that would help me support my family financially and pay for my college expenses. Unfortunately, opportunities in our region are severely limited due to a lack of awareness and technical issues such as power outages and network availability to limited areas. A Verified Certificate from this course helps me stand out and showcase my skills, creating a path to secure employment. This achievement wouldn't just alleviate my family's financial strain but also contribute to my education expenses.

As a student, my work experience has mainly been in internships, often without pay. This is mainly because I don't have much on my resume. Showcasing this certificate on my resume would make it stand out and help me present my skills. This could help me land a job in the local market or even a job that hires remotely and pays a decent amount of money. It would act like a signal to employers, showing them that I'm skilled and have potential. This, in turn, would pave the way for jobs that can genuinely support my family and my educational journey. Additionally, this certificate would represent a concrete step towards breaking the cycle of limited opportunities in my region.
