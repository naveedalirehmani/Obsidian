In the realm of front-end development, I specialize in turning designs into seamless user interfaces. Whether it's React.js, Next.js, or diving into the latest frameworks like Svelte, Nuxt, and Gatsby – I adapt to whatever the project demands.  

When it comes to backend frameworks, I'm well-versed in Node.js, Express, and GraphQL, ensuring your server-side is just as dynamic as the front. I also bring versatility, working with both NoSQL and SQL databases. Whether it's MongoDB for flexibility or MySQL for structured data, consider it handled.  
  
But it's not just about the code. As an experienced software engineer, I'm all about solid practices. I excel in Agile Development & QA processes for flexible project management and scalable software architecture.  

I've built web and mobile applications serving thousands, if not millions of users in real-time.  
  
Now, let me share why I'm your go-to expert.  

1. Client experience is my number one priority and that's reflected in the numerous five-star reviews on my profile.  
    
2. As the only developer on the job, I can handle everything, capable of taking your project from frontend to backend, all the way to managing cloud engineering & DevOps.  
    

Beyond my freelance work, I contribute to the tech community on platforms like Reddit & Medium, where I write articles about full-stack development and cloud engineering. Engaging with all kinds of tech enthusiasts, I'm passionate about sharing knowledge and helping others in the tech space.  

I'd love to hear about your project and, most importantly, how I can help you. Contact me today to schedule a quick introduction call, ensuring I'm the perfect fit for you.

I want to create a web application that manages users all email providers at one place, users can add their multiple profile such as gmail, another gmail profile, outlook etc.
they can see, send and reply to their mails in this one application for all profile. 
they can switch between profile on our application and manage mails for multiple providers like this.
I have already created a system where user oAuth's with his outlook account and their mails are listed, they can reply and compose mails.
but their are few problems.
1. I am not sure if this accesstoken that I'm getting when user authenticates with oAuth can be forever used for fetching mail data on user behave or it expires after a while. if it expires then we would have to ask user for re oAuth with each provider which is not a good scenerio.
2. I need you to suggest a system design for above, like the data flow of it. I'm fullstack and work with javascript next.js and node.js





Dear Northnine Team,

I loved working with you each day and I truly appreciate the time I spent at Northnine. I'm glad I had the opportunity to work with such great minds. Thank you all for the wonderful experience.

Best wishes,  
Naveed Ali Rehmani.


I'm creating a one in all mail provider web application. 
1. user creates a profile & sign in to their desired email provider ( gmail, outlook ) or even multiple gmail or outlook profiles in settings tab.
2. we fetch their access and refresh token by oAuth.
3. save this refresh token in database & redis related to their profile.
4. save the access token in user cookies. ( could be multiple for multiple providers )
5. user can select a profile from fronted by just a dropdown select.
6. lets say user selects that 1 gmail profile naveed123@gmail.com in this case as example
7. we try to fetch mails for this profile
	1. we try retrieve this access token for his specific profile which we set in signup cookies.
	2. we try to fetch mails by access token
	3. if expired we try to fetch refresh from redis cache
	4. if also does not exists there we fetch from database.
	5. revalited the access token with refresh token.
	6. reset user cookies with new access token.
