  
Probability and statistics are two areas of mathematics that deal with analyzing the likelihood of events and the collection, analysis, interpretation, presentation, and organization of data.

### Probability
Probability is about measuring the chance of something happening. Imagine you have a regular six-sided dice.

### Statistics
Statistics is about collecting, analyzing, interpreting, and presenting data. It helps us make sense of numerical data to understand what it tells us about a situation or phenomenon.

### Classical probability 
Is a concept in probability theory that applies when all the outcomes of an experiment are equally likely to happen. It’s based on the principle of symmetry, which means each outcome has the same chance of occurring as any other.

### How to Calculate Classical Probability
To calculate classical probability, you use the formula:
$$
P(E)= Number of favorable outcomes / Total number of possible outcomes
$$

Where:

- P(E) is the probability of an event E happening.
- The numerator (top part of the fraction) is the count of outcomes that are considered as "successes" or the ones you're interested in.
- The denominator (bottom part of the fraction) is the count of all possible outcomes in your scenario.

### A random experiment
Is a process or action that leads to one of several possible outcomes, where the exact outcome cannot be predicted with certainty in advance. 

The key characteristics of a random experiment are:
1. **Uncertainty**: The outcome of the experiment cannot be determined in advance.
2. **Multiple Outcomes**: There are several possible outcomes or results of the experiment.
3. **Repeatability**: The experiment can be performed multiple times under the same conditions.

### Mutual exclusivity 
In probability refers to events that cannot occur at the same time. If you have two events, A and B, they are mutually exclusive if the occurrence of A means B cannot occur, and vice versa. This means there is no overlap between the two events.

### Probability for non-mutual events

### Exhaustive events 
Are a collection of outcomes or events that cover all possible outcomes of a random experiment. In other words, the set of exhaustive events includes every possible outcome that can happen.

### Permutation & Combination.
Permutation and combination are two concepts in mathematics that deal with counting the number of ways things can be arranged or selected.

### Permutation:
A permutation is an arrangement of objects in a specific order. The order of the objects matters in permutations.

### Combination:
A combination involves selecting objects without regard to the order in which they are selected.
