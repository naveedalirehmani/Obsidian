#### NPV ( net present value ) 
![[Pasted image 20231007225447.png]]
let's say you invest 1000 in a project, and in course of 4 years it returns to you 3000. and the discount rate ( this can be inflation) is 10%
value of money with time decreases (which is discount rate here) so if a project returns a specific amount of value in a time period, NPV is basically finding the value of the return in present time, so that we can compare it with our invest to see if the future value holds a greater value in present time than our investment. so if NPV is greater than zero we should invest because NPV = our investment value in present time - return money value in present time.

#### IRR ( internal rate of return )
![[Pasted image 20231007225407.png]]

IRR basically  tells us the specific value of discount rate that will make this investment not profitable. for example if a project returns 200 with investment of 100 in 10 years with discount rate 1%. than this project might be profitable but if the discount rate is something like 100% this project might not be profitable. so IRR is basically  finding that specific discount rate value that will make this investment  not profitable


#### PI (profitability index)
basically means that what is the return that we get for each dollar, for example dividing cash inflow with cash outflow.
for example if we get 1.7 dollar for each 1 dollar we should except the project.

#### Payback Period
this is the break point in time at which we recover our initial investment, could be 2 years or 2 years 4 months 3 days.
