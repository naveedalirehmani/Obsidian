#### NPV ( net present value ) 
![[Pasted image 20231007225447.png]]
let's say you invest 1000 in a project, and in course of 4 years it returns to you 3000. and the discount rate ( this can be inflation) is 10%
value of money with time decreases (which is discount rate here) so if a project returns a specific amount of value in a time period, NPV is basically finding the value of the return in present time, so that we can compare it with our invest to see if the future value holds a greater value in present time than our investment. so if NPV is greater than zero we should invest because NPV = our investment value in present time - return money value in present time.
