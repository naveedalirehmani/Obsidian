#### NPV ( net present value )

let's say you invest 1000 in a project, and in course of 4 years it returns to you 3000. and the discount rate ( this can be inflation) is 10%
value of money with time decreases (which is discount rate here) so if a project returns a specific amount of value in a time period, NPV is basically finding the value of the return in present time, so that we can compare it with our invest to see if the future value holds a greater value in present time than our investment. so if NPV is greater than zero we should invest because NPV = our investment value in present time - return money value in present time.

#### IRR ( internal rate of return )

IRR basically  tells us the specific value of discount rate that will make this investment not profitable. for example if a project returns 200 with investment of 100 in 10 years with discount rate 1%. than this project might be profitable but if the discount rate is something like 100% this project might not be profitable. so IRR is basically  finding that specific discount rate value that will make this investment  not profitable
