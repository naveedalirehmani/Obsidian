1. Initially, the revenue will be shared in a `15/85` ratio between both parties. where the office keeps `15%`, while I will be entitled to `85%` of the total generated income on my profile.
2. I will oversee the training of office employees and manage web development projects within the office.    
3. I will receive `5%` of the total income generated by the development department.
4. After three ==3 years==, the revenue model will be adjusted. I will no longer receive `5%` of the generated income by the web development department, and the revenue on my profile will be divided by `30/70`, where I will be entitled to `70%` of the income and the office retaining `30%`.
