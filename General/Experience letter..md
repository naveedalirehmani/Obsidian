Subject: Employee Agreement Discussion

Date: November 27, 2023

Dear HR,

I want to discuss the employee agreement from Northnine. I've decided not to accept this role. In my defense, I wasn't told about the 3-year employment agreement in our earlier meetings.

I'm happy to keep working as a developer at Northnine, and I am willing to contribute as much as I can to the growth of the development department as long as I'm here. I agree to the 70/30 revenue model like the other members. Also, I don't want to take any earnings from the development team.

I sincerely apologies for any inconvenience caused on my behave. none of this was intentional.

Best regards, 
Naveed Ali Rehmani.
